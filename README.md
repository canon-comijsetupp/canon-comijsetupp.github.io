## Troubleshoot Printer Problems on a Windows PC:

Check the Toner or Ink:  Please check the toner level or ink level as there is a very high possibility that you are encountering this problem because of less ink. You cannot print a document unless you have enough ink. In case you are just using the black and white ink even then there are some pointers that will create a problem if colored is not refilled.

Update or Reinstall the Printer Drivers: In case this problem is not caused because of low toner or ink levels, then this may be happening because the printer driver is not updated. You may have to reinstall or update the drivers if they are not working properly. Ideally, printers work properly and their drivers get installed automatically but this does not always happen.
